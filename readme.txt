--Readme document for Piersen Zambrano, plzambra@uci.edu

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

9.5/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 1.5/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
1: Links to external page(s)
2: Appropriate headings and paragraph text
3: Semantic HTML tags aside
4: Custom icons using Google Material Icons


(b) CSS features

2: Modifying text color, and hover to be visually appealing
3: Leveraging Bootstrap CSS for table layouts and nav bar to display content better
4: Added custom font with Google fonts


(c) Advanced features
1: Created a nav bar to navigate the website smoothly
2: Created a table with multiple columns and rows that can be read with a screen reader
3: Nested selectors to specify formats



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
No, every error I got I fixed because they all made sense logically, for example I went from a h2 to a h4 under, instead of h3.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
It took me around 6 hours to complete this assignment, the first hour being just getting used to html and css syntax.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
I used W3 schools to skim the possible tags and properties I could change 
but I had a difficult time understanding their explanations so I often used 
Google Gemini to explain what they did and how they interacted with the website.


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I didn't discuss with any classmates for this assignment.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
I didn't download bootstrap I used a CDN. But I don't think that will make a difference.
